I did this project to **get acquainted** to the used tools (**Selenium Webdriver** to automate the tests (with Javascript) and **Cucumber** to write the results of them (with Gherkin). Nevertheless, I've added Mocha to run all the tests in parallel). <br>Therefore, the **paths** to get until the **respective documents** are:
### * Testing deeper the Input-Output feature with 10 items: Test/1stSeleniumExercise.js;
### * Doing same (plus printing a message whether the Boolean is True or False at the Terminal's Output) but shorter and smarter with _FOR_. 2.1 version: Test/2ndSeleniumExercise.js;
### * Doing the same as the 2ndSeleniumExercise.js, but with Workout related tasks. 4.0 version: Test/3rdSeleniumExercise.js;
### * Transcribing the project into Gherkin: features/Match.feature;
