I did this project to **get acquainted** to the used tools (**Selenium Webdriver** to automate the test (with Javascript) and **Cucumber** to write the result of the it (with Gherkin)). <br>Therefore, the **paths** to get until the **respective documents** are:
### * Grasping Selenium Webdriver by testing the given website's feature: Tests/fistTest.js;
### * Testing deeper the Input-Output feature with 10 items: Selenium-Exercises/1stSeleniumExercise.js;
### * Transcribing the project into Gherkin: features/Match.feature;
### * Doing same (plus printing a message whether the Boolean is True or False at the Terminal's Output) but shorter and smarter with _FOR_. 2.1 version: Selenium-Exercises/2ndSeleniumExercise.js;
